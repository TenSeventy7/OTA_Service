**Core**

* Fixed isolated deadlock issues caused by a change in the thermal management module.
* Reverted performance patches to ones from 3.0.96.

#### Changes to the Beta Branch

To encourage testers to wipe data to fix some bugs, including Photo Editor, **testers on the 'beta' branch will not be migrated to stable and will stop receiving updates after 3.0.98.**

Users will have the choice to flash 'stable' themselves, but it is strongly recommended to wipe and flash clean to fix most issues.

An 'upstream' branch will be available after stable release if testers do choose to keep testing newer releases, and to follow the branch naming convention of Fresh Core.

I apologize for the inconvenience.
