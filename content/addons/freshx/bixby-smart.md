## Do more with Bixby.

Bixby Routines is a feature bolstered by machine learning to adapt to your life, suggesting ways to make your phone time more streamlined. The automated actions are triggered by context clues: location, time, or event.

When your device connects to the Bluetooth in your car, Bixby Routines can do a variety of apps and settings—like pulling up the Maps app, opening your music app, and keeping your phone unlocked for easy access—to add convenience to your drive.

Or if you fall asleep without putting your phone on the charger at night, it will shut down unnecessary functions to save on battery life. 

You also have the option to create a custom routine that meets your individual needs with My Routine.
