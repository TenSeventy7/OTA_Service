### Open a new desktop world with Samsung DeX

Multitask between devices like a boss. Connect your Galaxy to your monitor or TV to bring it to life on the big screen. And now, with just a USB cable, unlock your phone's possibilities on PC and Mac through Samsung DeX.

#### Upgrade your day-to-day

Everyday projects, errands and tasks are about to get a major upgrade. Samsung DeX turns your smartphone into a daily dashboard, so you can bring more of your life with you without having to lug a laptop.

#### Two screens at once

Take multitasking to the next level. In Samsung DeX mode, you can take a closer look at things like videos, artwork, and documents on a larger display while still using your phone as a phone.

Watch movies on the monitor while checking texts, or take a call while reviewing documents without breaking your focus. With Samsung DeX, you have two screens to do twice as much.

#### Take it to the big screen

Many apps you use every day are optimized to work naturally as you switch between screens.

Go from MS Office Suite to Adobe Sketch or a web browser to YouTube. You can use them on your device, then enjoy them even more on a bigger display.

With your favorite apps on Samsung DeX, you'll get things done in no time, and with an even bigger view.

#### Bring Samsung DeX to your computer

A simple USB cable unlocks Samsung DeX on your computer. Easily drag and drop files between devices, or use a mouse and keyboard to get even more done on your PC and Mac.
