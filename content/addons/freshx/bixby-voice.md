## Do more with Bixby.

**Bixby frees you to focus on what matters the most.**

It learns what you like to do and works with your favorite apps and services to help you get more done.

### Make it simpler with Quick commands

**Take a load off with a Quick Command.**

Bixby carries out multiple tasks in a specific order upon hearing a trigger you've set up. For example, start your day fresh by having Bixby read aloud your messages, remind you of the day's schedule, and start your office playlist – all with a "good morning".

### Enjoy a connected life with Bixby

**Manage your smart devices with just your voice.**

If your devices are connected to SmartThings, Bixby is at the ready to listen and carry out your requests. From changing the TV channel to switching off all the lights at night, just leave it to Bixby.

### Bixby is for everyone

**Make your Galaxy devices more accessible and usable with the help of Bixby.**

You can switch on or off the Accessibility features with your voice, have Bixby read your unread messages aloud.

### Let Bixby type

Anytime the keyboard is on the screen, simply press and hold the Side Key and speak naturally to dictate whatever you need to type without exhausting your thumbs. To use Bixby dictation, enable the feature on Bixby settings.
