Includes **Link to Windows** and **Call and text on other devices.**

Don't you hate it when your phone starts ringing once youâ€™re snuggled up and comfortable in bed? With the Call & text on other devices feature, you can make and receive calls on your tablet as long as it's signed into the same Samsung account as your phone. You can also send messages. However, the connected phone will need to have active service.

Link to Windows takes everything that you can do on your smartphone and brings it to convenience and familiarity of your PC. Using the Your Phone app, you can send texts, see recent photos, triage notifications, and use any of your favourite mobile apps - all without ever having to take your phone out of your pocket.
