**Dangerous addon!** Samsung has changed how "special users", like the Dual Messenger profile, are managed on One UI 3. This is causing **bootloops** on devices with **Dual Messenger enabled and lock screen security set.**

To be able to use Dual Messenger for the meantime, install this addon **and disable lock screen security.** Full support for Dual Messenger will be reinstated on Fresh once I find a workaround, or alternative.

Dual Messenger capability lets you use two different accounts with one chatting app. That means you can keep your accounts for work and home separate, but on the same phone.

To use two accounts, first long press the messaging app icon. Tap "Install second app" from the menu to install the same app again. The second app will be marked with the Dual Messenger logo to avoid confusion.
