### Fresh 3.2.291 RC

This is a quick set of changes from 3.2.29 Prestable.

**Core**

* Improve battery endurance.
* Switch to 'maple' as default I/O scheduler because of RAM Plus.
* Minor improvements to efficiency and performance.

**System**

* Fix a potential issue with Wi-Fi Hotspot on certain devices.
* Swap device fingerprint to regenerate ART cache. This should fix camera and photo editor breakage.

You will **not** be migrated to the stable 3.2.3 build. This is the current release state that will be released to the public. Instead, you will be migrated to the next 3.2.81 build immediately as development for Fresh 3.3 begins. If you wish, you may flash 3.2.3 stable manually once it has been released.

Thank you for joining the beta programme.
