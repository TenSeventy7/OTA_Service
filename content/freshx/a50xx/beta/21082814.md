### Fresh 3.2.26 Beta

**Core**

* **Re-strategize system memory management.** It now closely matches the one I was testing pre-3.2.23B instead of the one shipping on the betas right now. I also took inspiration from the Galaxy M21, an Exynos961x device, with KillPolicyManager completely disabled.
* Re-enable Pressure Sensitive Indicators and disable Process Reclaiming in kernel.
* Re-add OOM reaping on SIGKILL in kernel.
