**System**

* August 2021 security patches from Samsung, based on CUHx builds.

* Tweak how Samsung Low Memory Killer (sLMK) handles "pressure" from kernel PSI indicators.
* Major tweaks to Samsung's Hyper CPU booster to improve UI performance.
* Alleviate the vendor issue of the Wi-Fi driver crashing due to load, causing the device to reboot.
* Enable Android Runtime (ART) heap compaction to have apps consume less memory.
* ART tweaks following Android Go specifications to lessen the tendency for apps (notably YouTube) to eat too much RAM.
* Updated thermal thresholds according to latest vendor release.

**Experience**
